# Elf Run

A project for practicing JavaScript

## Introduction

This project is half built for you.

Your job is to use the techniques we learned this week to add to this game. Now, it can move left and right. Your job is to make it move up and down.

You'll also notice that it doesn't turn its body when it moves. You'll need to fix it so that it face the direction it is moving.

Finally, there are 5 cookies.  Two of them have been places on the screen. The other three are piled up in the top left. (They look like one cookie, but there are really three on top of one another.) You must place them in different places on the board, as you choose.

(As a bonus, you can make the cookies disappear when the elf touches them!)


## Detailed instructions

Try to take things one step at a time.

If you have code that doesn't work, stop and try to figure it out before moving on. Otherwise, you won't be able to find the bugs in the code.

1. Look over `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` to try and understand the HTML elements, the styles, and the functions that make the page display.
2. Look for the `TODO` comments to get an idea of what you will be doing.
3. Start with the up button. It has a function written, but its onclick is not set. Set the button to call `walkUp` when clicked.
4. Try it, and COMMIT to git if it works!
5. Move on the the walkDown function. It is incomplete. Write it and create a button to call walkDown `onclick`.
6. Try it, and COMMIT to git if it works!
7. Move on to the cookies. Two cookies are done for you. Place the other cookies on the board.
8. Try it, and COMMIT to git if it works!

### Bonus

* Add a background or other images if like.
* Use a for-loop to place cookies, and make more cookie objects.
* Try to figure out how to make the cookies disappear when the elf "eats" them.
* Keep track of the eaten cookies for a score!
