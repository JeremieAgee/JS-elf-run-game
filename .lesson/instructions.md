# Instructions  

## Introduction

This project is half built for you.

Your job is to use the techniques we learned this week to add to this game. Now, it can change red and turn left. You will need to make it change green and blue. And also turn right, up, and down.

(As a bonus, you can make it move around the larger box!)


## Detailed instructions

Try to take things one step at a time.

If you have code that doesn't work, stop and try to figure it out before moving on. Otherwise, you won't be able to find the bugs in the code.

1. Look over `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` to try and understand the HTML elements, the styles, and the functions that make the page display.
2. Look for the `TODO` comments to get an idea of what you will be doing.
3. Start with the Green button. Add to the `setGreen` function so that it change the style of `main-box` to green.
4. Do the same to the Blue button.
5. Move on to the Right button.
6. Move on to the Up and Down buttons. (You need to create buttons in `index.html`)

### Bonus

* Use Git to track your changes.
* Add Bootstrap to the project.
* Try making the elf move when you click the buttons.
* Try making the elf move when you press the arrow buttons on the keyboard.
* Try making the elf move when you click on the elf sprite.
* Research the `if` statement and try to prevent the elf from moving off the "board".
* Add other sprites to the board, like cookie or a hole.
* Add a background.
* Anthing else, and add that to the Readme!
